    <h1>Test SWC</h1>
    <p>
      Below is a custom element created with @microsoft/fast-element. It uses class and property decorators, and they
      don't work correctly when the component definition is transpiled with swc. The greeting property of the custom
      element is set to "Hola" in the html, but this is never seen by the component, which defaults to "Hello".
    </p>
    <name-tag greeting="Hola"></name-tag>
